    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> This Privacy Policy is effective as of
      the date you first use Bangumi App.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bangumi App (referred to as "the App" or "we") takes your privacy
      seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your personal
      information and how we protect your privacy rights. Please read this
      Privacy Policy carefully.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Information Collection and Storage</h3>

    <p>
      To provide you with a better user experience, the App stores the
      following information locally on your device:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Authentication Credentials:</strong> Used to maintain your login
        session so you don't need to log in repeatedly
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content Cache:</strong> Used to improve app responsiveness and
        reduce network requests
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Preferences:</strong> Used to save your personalized
        settings
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> All of the above information is stored only
      locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any
      information on our servers. Your data is completely under your control.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Login Information Management</h3>

    <p>When you log in using the App:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The App uses the developer platform API provided by bgm.tv for
        authentication
      </li>
      <li>
        Your username and password are submitted directly to bgm.tv in an
        isolated web browser, separate from the App
      </li>
      <li>The App does not access, store, or transmit your login password</li>
      <li>
        To maintain your login session, the App stores the authentication token
        (Access Token) returned by the bgm.tv API
      </li>
      <li>
        Authentication information is encrypted and stored using iOS Keychain
        services to ensure security
      </li>
      <li>
        When you log out from within the App, all authentication information is
        immediately deleted from the Keychain
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Data Security</h3>

    <p>We employ the following measures to protect your data security:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Using iOS Keychain services to encrypt and store sensitive
        authentication information
      </li>
      <li>
        All data is stored only locally on your device and is never uploaded to
        any server
      </li>
      <li>
        All communications between the App and bgm.tv servers are encrypted via
        HTTPS
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Information Collection and Usage</h3>

    <p>
      <strong
        >The App does not collect, transmit, or share any personal
        information.</strong
      >
      We do not:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Collect your personal identification information</li>
      <li>Track your usage behavior</li>
      <li>Share or sell your information to third parties</li>
      <li>Use any analytics tools or advertising tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>

    <p>
      The App retrieves data through the bgm.tv developer platform API. Your
      data usage is subject to bgm.tv's privacy policy. We recommend that you
      review
      <a href="https://bgm.tv/about/privacy" target="_blank"
        >bgm.tv's Privacy Policy</a
      >
      for more information.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Data Deletion</h3>

    <p>
      You can delete all data stored by the App at any time through the
      following methods:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Log out from within the App, which will delete all authentication
        information
      </li>
      <li>
        Delete app cache data (via iOS Settings > General > iPhone Storage)
      </li>
      <li>Uninstall and reinstall the App</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Since authentication information stored in the
      Keychain may not be automatically cleared after app deletion, if you wish
      to completely clear all personal information, we recommend logging out
      first, then deleting the App.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>

    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Privacy Policy Updates</h3>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. For significant
      changes, we will notify you within the App or through other means. Your
      continued use of the App after such modifications constitutes your
      acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Contact Us</h3>
